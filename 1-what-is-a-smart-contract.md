# Smart Contracts Quick Intro

This is a short (1 hour üò±) workshop that will be a very quick intro in smart contracts.
* We will be using Ethereum / Solidity
* The online code editor Remix Ethereum (https://remix.ethereum.org/), no need to download anything!

### Questions:
* Who has worked with Ethereum/ solidity before ?
* Who has worked with Javascript or another programing language?
* Who owns ETH?


### What is Ethereum?
* An open source public blockchain
* Intial release 30 July 2015

Developers can connect to the network using **web3.js** and consumers can connect to DAPP's on the ethereum network using [**Mist browser**](https://github.com/ethereum/mist) or [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/)
